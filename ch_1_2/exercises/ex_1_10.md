### Exercise 1.10.

```
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))

I think I have lost the ability to do math, as it has been long, so I might work on it when I am bored sometime in the future. As it would still make my brain work in a better fashion, but will not teach me the programming I want to learn ? I might be even wrong to write all this, but I am lazy.
